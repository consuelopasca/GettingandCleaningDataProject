Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
I will be graded by my peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. I will be required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

I should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 
This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.


R script called run_analysis.R does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 
activity and each subject.


Codebook
Available on this repository as Codebook.md with an abridged version of the codebook containing information pertaining to all steps involved in this project and the variable names along with descriptive statistical information for each variable.
